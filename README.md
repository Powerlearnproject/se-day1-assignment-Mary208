Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering refers to the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain a high-quality software system. in technology industry it is applied in creation of reliable,scalable and innovative software solutions that meet user needs. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages, eg. Fortran
In1960s, establishment of software engineering as a discipline
Adrention of structured progtamming in 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
it has 6 phases
requirements- involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
design-creating high level designs and architecture
implementation-writing code and building software as per the design
testing- conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality statndards and functional requirements 
deployment-releasing the software to users and customers
maintenance-supporting, updating and enhancing software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach where the project is divided into distinct phases. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins, with little to no overlap while Agile is an iterative, incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.Waterfall is used when:
The project has clear, unchanging requirements.
Detailed documentation is essential for legal or compliance reasons.
The project is large and requires strict control over timelines and budge
Agile is used  when:
The project requirements are expected to evolve over time.
Early delivery of parts of the product is advantageous.
The project involves a lot of user interaction and feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- writes code and implements software solutions
quality assurance engineer- designs and executes test plans hence ensures software quality
project manager- oversees planning,execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code eg.visual studios,Eclipse
VCS provides tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg.Git,subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a]Changing Requirements
Challenge: Requirements often change during the development process, which can lead to scope creep, delays, and increased costs.
Strategies to Overcome:
Adopt Agile Methodologies: Use iterative development processes like Agile to accommodate changes more easily.
Frequent Communication: Maintain regular communication with stakeholders to ensure alignment and to manage expectations.
Flexible Architecture: Design software with modularity and flexibility in mind, allowing easier adaptation to changes.
 
 b]Technical Debt
Challenge: Accumulating shortcuts or suboptimal solutions to meet deadlines can lead to technical debt, which affects future development and maintenance.
Strategies to Overcome:
Refactoring,Code Reviews,Documentation

c]Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes
Challenge: The tech industry evolves rapidly, making it difficult to stay updated with new languages, frameworks, and best practices.
Strategies to Overcome:
Continuous learning,Community Involvement,Focus on Fundamentals

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit-testing indidvidual components of a software
intergration-testing intersction between duifferent components or subsystems
system-testing the entire siftware system as a whole
acceptance-testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets users needs
importance; help identify and fix defects early in development process leading to higher quality of a software system
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt enginnering is the process of carefully crafting the input (or "prompt") given to an AI model, like ChatGPT, to get the best possible response.
importance; avoid getting confusing answers by making questions clear and specific so that AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
what are the requiremnts to do a nursing course instead, i would improve it to, what are the most important requirements to do a degree in nursing at the university of nairobi as a self sponsored student
